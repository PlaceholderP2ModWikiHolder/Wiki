# Welcome to the PlaceholderMod Wiki
PlaceholderMod is a Portal 2 mod built on a unique engine that can differ significantly from the original Source Engine. This wiki is designed to make the process of developing third-party content for PlaceholderMod easy and well-documented.

Currently, PlaceholderMod supports Code Mods, Content Mods, and standalone game-like mods. To get started with creating a Mod see **[Intro to Modding](modding/intro)**
